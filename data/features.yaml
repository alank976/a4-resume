    I'm a software enthusiast who's spent 7 years exploring the ins and outs of the FinTech and Investment banking worlds. My coding journey has been a mix of Java, Kotlin, Go, and Python, resulting in a blend of creative solutions and practical experience.

    Recently, I've been diving into the world of Rust, experimenting with various toy projects that showcase to acquire a taste for it.

    Orchestration is a must in modern microservices architecture. When it comes to Kubernetes, I'm the go-to person, and using tools like Terraform is my specialty - I engineer structured infrastructure setups that empower the team to thrive even in my absence.

    While I can certainly handle frontend development using React and so on, I feel most at home delving into the depths of backend work and the intricacies of DevOps.

    What really drives me? The unending desire to learn. I regularly explore online articles, browse through dev.to discussions, and even tune into online conferences. I'm not just riding the tech wave; I'm shaping it by staying ahead of the curve on backend, DevOps, and architectural trends.
