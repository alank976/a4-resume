    I'm a software enthusiast who's spent 10 years exploring the ins and outs of the FinTech and Investment banking worlds. My coding journey has been a mix of Java, Kotlin, Go, and Python, resulting in a blend of creative solutions and practical experience.

    Sometimes, I've immersed myself in the world of Rust, engaging in diverse toy projects that provide a hands-on exploration to develop a taste of memory-safety.

    In the realm of modern microservices architecture, orchestration is imperative. As the go-to person for Kubernetes, I excel in leveraging tools like Terraform to craft structured infrastructure systems that empower the team's sustained success, even in my absence.

    While I can certainly handle frontend development with React and more, I feel most at home delving into the depths of backend work and the intricacies of DevOps.

    Fuelled by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I actively explore online articles, engage in dev.to discussions, and participate in virtual conferences. I'm committed to shaping the ever-evolving tech landscape by staying ahead of backend, DevOps, and architectural trends
